# MakeshiftPoker
An "attempt" at coding the inner workings of Poker, entirely done on base Java libraries

Because of this, the game runs entirely on console, with simple checks and prompts to the user to progress forward

This was started around March, alonside CS210Poker (it was started due to disagreements on fundamental data structure and parsing), but due to waning interest (and code complexity getting the better of me), it was pushed aside

As of 24/5/24, this project is around 99% complete. It still has "some" bugs (it can fail to initalize from time to time, due to an OutOfBounds Exception that really shouldn't be happening)

The main drive of finishing this project was a CodeDay Hackathon at Bellevue College on 24/5/24, but cumulitive hours spent on this project is no lower than 50h

There are still some feature that I wanted to implement (Mainly more than 2 player count, as well as something better than PrintStream for seperate player viewpoints), but will take too much refactoring

Another big issue is that the game all runs in one class, which undoubtedly makes the code more difficult to read. It is commented to the best of my abilities, but seperating it into multiple class would have massively increased readability

This code was concocted by someone with less than 2 quarters of Basic Java fundamental classes, merely as a proof of concept (and as a way to guage further interest into CS in general)

Critiques and laughter are more than welcome!
